/*

	variable defintions follow the form:

	variable_name: 'variable value';

	it is good practice to use an uncommon and consistent naming convention or prefix for variable names
	so that replacements are not made against actual words that might occur in the markdown text.

	for example, variable names starting with double @ symbols might work nicely, e.g.:

	@@product_name: 'Acme Toaster 2000';
	@@serial_number: 'ABCDEFG12345';
